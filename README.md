# Hello-world 
# Indeed , Hello-wolrd
This would be my first edit in Github
## Testing the git cli with a couple of changes into the file
Is it working?
How do I make a commit?
##  Overall it seems to be working
- [x] first commit and pull were done
- [x] created a guide for future
- [ ] turn the repo back to private

## Commands that have been used:
```
git checkout -b "whatever" # creates a new branch with that specified name
git status # see the status of the branch and the staged files

git add "myfile.file" # to specify what files to stage

git commit -m "whatever text" # specify the commit with a short description"

git push origin "whatever" #without the "" will push the newly created branch to develop

```
## Notes
I've encountered also a short detour while trying to push because I haven't set up an authentication for the Github CLI but this has been solved by generating a classic token.
